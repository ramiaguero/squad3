Testing Workflow with pre_build.tf

    Run Pre-Build Configuration First:
        Execute the pre_build.tf separately before running the main PostgreSQL setup.
        Use:

    terraform init
    terraform apply -target=<resources_to_create_first>

    For example, target specific resources like SSM parameters or the KMS key.

Integrate Outputs:

    Use the outputs from pre_build.tf (e.g., KMS key ARN, SSM parameter name) as inputs for the PostgreSQL module.

Update locals.tf with the appropriate values:

kms_key_arn = data.aws_kms_key.encryption_key.arn
db_password_param = "/production/db/master_password"

Run Main PostgreSQL Setup:

    After running pre_build.tf, proceed to the PostgreSQL module.
    Execute:

        terraform plan
        terraform apply

    Validation:
        Confirm that the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster is using the KMS key and SSM-stored password.
        Verify that dependent resources (like VPC, subnets, etc.) are correctly linked.

Key Notes

    Standalone Testing: The pre_build.tf can be used independently if you need to set up prerequisites in other workflows or for different Aurora clusters.
    Reusability: Since the pre_build.tf uses modularized configurations (e.g., data.aws_kms_key, data.aws_ssm_parameter), it can easily adapt to different environments (e.g., production, development) by switching locals.

By ensuring that the pre_build.tf runs first, you decouple prerequisite creation from the main module, reducing potential errors.



Alignment with MySQL and PostgreSQL Configurations
1. Locals (iam_usernames)

    The iam_usernames list provides placeholders for IAM users who should connect to the database.
    This is generic and works seamlessly for both MySQL and PostgreSQL setups.

2. AWS Region and Account

    The data "aws_caller_identity" "current" and data "aws_region" "current" ensure dynamic fetching of the current AWS region and account.
    These values are used in the IAM policy for rds-db:connect, making them universally applicable to any Aurora database setup.

3. KMS Key for DB Encryption

    Both MySQL and PostgreSQL configurations require a KMS key for encryption.
    The resource names (aws_kms_key.db_encryption and aws_kms_alias.db_encryption_alias) are consistent across both implementations.

Usage in Modules:

    In MySQL:

storage_encrypted = true
kms_key_id        = data.aws_kms_key.encryption_key.arn

In PostgreSQL:

    storage_encrypted = true
    kms_key_id        = data.aws_kms_key.encryption_key.arn

Both configurations fetch the key dynamically from the presetup.
4. SSM Parameter for DB Password

    The aws_ssm_parameter.db_master_password resource stores the master password securely in SSM Parameter Store.
    The name (/production/db/master_password) and type (SecureString) are consistent with the variable var.db_master_password.

Usage in Modules:

    In MySQL:

master_username = local.master_username
master_password = data.aws_ssm_parameter.master_password.value

In PostgreSQL:

    master_username = local.master_username
    master_password = data.aws_ssm_parameter.master_password.value

Both modules rely on the same SSM Parameter.
5. IAM Policy for RDS Connection

    The aws_iam_policy.rds_connect and aws_iam_user_policy_attachment.rds_policy_attachments provide IAM users the ability to connect to the database instances.

Usage in Both Iterations:

    This is a foundational configuration to allow RDS connectivity and does not need customization between MySQL and PostgreSQL.

6. Resource Tags

    Tags such as Environment and Name are consistent across all resources.
    These tags are used in both configurations to help identify resources in the AWS Console.

Validation Checklist for Naming and Values

    KMS Key and Alias
        Name: aurora-encryption-key
        Used consistently in both configurations.

    SSM Parameter
        Name: /production/db/master_password
        Securely fetched by both configurations.

    IAM Policy
        rds-db:connect is generic and supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

    Region and Account
        Dynamically fetched using data "aws_region" and data "aws_caller_identity".
        Supports all iterations without modification.

What Adjustments are NOT Needed

    MySQL vs PostgreSQL Differences:
        The presetup is independent of the engine (aurora-mysql or aurora-postgresql) and works for both setups.
    Instance Configuration:
        Instance classes (db.t2.micro or others) are handled in the module and do not impact presetup.

Final Confirmation

Yes, the presetup aligns perfectly with both the MySQL and PostgreSQL configurations. It ensures reusability and consistency across iterations. Let me know if you'd like further refinements or testing steps!
